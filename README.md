# Forecasting-Electricity-Consumption-in-the-Philippines-Using-ARIMA-Models-Code-and-Data
This repository contains code for forecasting electricity demand in the Philippines, as in the research paper "Forecasting Electricity Consumption in the Philippines Using ARIMA Models" by Samuel John E. Parreno. The research paper investigates the patterns and trends in electricity demand and proposes a forecasting model using ARIMA. The paper is published in the International Journal of Machine Learning and Computing.

## Contents

- *Power Consumption from 1973 to 2015:* This file contains electricity consumption from 1973 to 2015. This data is used in building the ARIMA model.

- *Power Consumption from 2016 to 2020:* This file contains electricity consumption from 2016 to 2020. This data is used in model validation.

- *R Codes:* This file contains the R scripts used for data preprocessing, model training, and generating the forecasts. The scripts utilize the `forecast` package in R, which provides functions specifically designed for time series analysis and forecasting.
